🧠 Luminalogix Backend Roadmap
This roadmap outlines all backend features grouped by priority level and delivery phase: MVP → Growth → Optimization.

✅ Phase 1: MVP (Essential + Basic)
User Authentication (Register, Login)


Password Hashing (bcrypt)


JWT Token Management


Global Error Handler


Environment Config (.env)


Prisma ORM Setup


User Role Management (user/admin)


Product CRUD (Admin)


Cart API


Order API (basic)


API Health Route (/api/health)



📈 Phase 2: Growth (Intermediate)
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)


Stripe Payments Integration


Transactional Emails (SendGrid/Resend)


Image Uploads to Cloudinary


CMS-like Blog (Journal/Stories)


Admin Dashboard Routes


Scheduled Jobs (e.g., Clear stale carts)


API Logging (winston or pino)


Centralized Validation (Zod)



🚀 Phase 3: Optimization (Advanced)
Rate Limiting (express-rate-limit)


CSRF/XSS Protection


Redis Cache (product, session, auth)


Full Analytics Logging (PostHog / custom)


Webhooks (Stripe, CMS events)


OAuth Support (Google, Facebook)


Versioned APIs (/api/v1, /api/v2)


Testing Suite (Jest + Supertest + Playwright)


Multi-Tenant Logic (optional)


CI/CD Pipeline & Monitoring (GitHub Actions, UptimeRobot)



🛠 Technologies Used
Express + Node.js


PostgreSQL + Prisma


JWT + bcrypt


Stripe + Cloudinary


Zod (validation)


SendGrid or Resend (emails)
